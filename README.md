# HearthStone Memory Card Game

This is my first thing that I built with React.js. Generally React basics are practiced (Hooks, JSX, state/props)

The game logic is really simple. Player choose a card that s/he didn't choose at his/her last choice. The aim of the game is not to repaet his/her choice until reaching the max score of 13.

## Instructions

Use `npm install` to install required packages.
Then to make it work use `npm start`.

## Future Additions:

- Level system
- Loading & win/lose screens
-
